# Overview

The Cluster Stack Provider OpenStack (CSPO) works with the Cluster Stack Operator (CSO) and Cluster Stacks, enabling the creation of Kubernetes clusters in a Cluster-API-native (CAPI) fashion.

The primary goal of the CSPO is to facilitate the import of node images in a manner specific to OpenStack. These images are then used to create Kubernetes workload clusters on top of the OpenStack infrastructure.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire concept, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the fundamental [concepts](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/blob/main/docs/concept.md) and [architecture](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/blob/main/docs/architecture/overview.md) outlined in [CSO](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-operator/blob/main/README.md) and [Cluster Stacks](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks/blob/main/README.md).
